This directory contains the glib json implementation for processing the /ect/pbrconfig.json config file.
The glib json implementation was used for this project to accomodate the requirement of running on the 
10.4 LTS server version of Ubuntu that has a rather old (1.40) version of boost. The boost json library
was first introduced in 1.41, so using boost wasn't an option. Once there is a new LTS release for ubuntu
we may want to replace the implementation in this dir with one that uses the boost json library instead.
