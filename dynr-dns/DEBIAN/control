Description: The dns subsystem of the dynr (dynamic router) system.
 The dynr (dynamic router) is a simple web based gateway selection tool. 
 This package provides the DNS proxy and a related dbus service for implementing
 the application level policy based NAT and policy based forwarding needed for dynr 
 to work. The dbus service is provided in order to allow the dynr-web subsystem to 
 administer the per workstation DNS policy.
