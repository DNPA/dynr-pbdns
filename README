This repository contains the sources for building one of 3 ubuntu deb packages 
that together make up the dynamic router lite project (DynrLite-II).

The DynrLite-II project allows placing a so called dynamic router between a lan
that contains workstations and a lan that contains internet gateways. The dynamic 
router has a simple web interface that lets the users on the workstations pick
or switch what gateway they want to use. 

The dynr-pbdns package provides the code for a policy based dns forwarding daemon.
This daemon will, in sync with how the policy based routing is configured forward
DNS queries to the gateway any given workstation is using at that moment.
This gateway should have a DNS service configured for dynr-pbdns to work.
The daemon is written in C++ and uses the boost::asio library at its core.

Other components of the DynrLite-II project are dynr-pbrouting (A policy based routing core)
and dynr-web (the web interface),

All DynrLite-II packages are distributed by the dutch national police agency (KLPD) under
the LGPL open source software licence.
